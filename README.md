midas-open-opportunities
========================

The goal of Open Opportunities is to foster a network of federal employees that will lead to a more effective, efficient, responsive government by sharing skills and collaborating on projects that support the mission of an agency or the government as a whole.

[Open Opportunities](http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/category/open-opportunities/) started as a thriving community using a simple WordPress implementation, which was effective for its initial pilot. To support its rapid growth, it has moved to the [Midas open source platform](https://github.com/18F/midas) -- this repository will host custom configuration and the list of issues that are specific to this instance.
